Hi team,

This is our regular weekly standup and planning session where we'll discuss:

• Progress updates from last week
• Current blockers and challenges  
• Goals for the upcoming week
• Sprint planning for next iteration
• Any questions, announcements, or process improvements

Please come prepared with your updates and any blockers you're facing. We'll also do some light planning for the next sprint.

Looking forward to seeing everyone!

Best regards,
Sarah
